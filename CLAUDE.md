# Clinic WhatsApp Bot

WhatsApp AI receptionist for UAE dental clinics (Dubai first), English + Arabic. Original plan: `~/.claude/plans/i-want-to-make-tender-wall.md`. Earlier roadmap ("revenue receptionist", R0-R8): `~/.claude/plans/check-up-the-whatsapp-ethereal-pearl.md`.
**Current roadmap (2026-10-25): white-label multi-clinic platform** with web chat widget, staff dashboard (front-desk CRM) and analytics, phases P0-P5: `~/.claude/plans/load-up-the-superwer-cozy-firefly.md`. Per-phase task plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Decisions
- WhatsApp via **UltraMsg** (owner's decision, no Meta). Unofficial, so the number can be banned: use a spare SIM, pace sends, no WhatsApp buttons. All provider code lives in `src/lib/whatsapp.ts`.
- Next.js route handlers (Vercel Hobby). Webhook: `POST /api/whatsapp?secret=WEBHOOK_SECRET`, returns 200 fast, work runs in `after()`.
- AI: `@openai/agents` (SDK default model, override with `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL`). The LLM never invents slots; it only calls booking tools. Vercel Chat SDK was evaluated and skipped: its WhatsApp adapter is Meta Cloud API only.
- Data: Supabase. Schema in `supabase/migrations/`, sample clinic in `supabase/seed.sql`; the owner runs SQL in the Supabase SQL editor. Many clinics per deployment (tenants, since P0). Synthetic/fake clinic data only, labeled sample. No real patient data until a UAE-region host is in place.
- Safety: no medical advice, emergency reply with the UAE emergency number, never confirm insurance coverage, human handoff, no PHI in logs.
- Persona "Sara", the clinic receptionist. She admits she is the clinic's virtual assistant if asked. Clinic topics only; off-topic questions get a one-line kind decline and a steer back to booking, never a handoff.
- No SDK input/output guardrails: each one is an extra model call per message. Scope rules live in the prompt; safety-critical checks are deterministic code.

## Rules
- The owner's phone number and all keys stay in `.env.local` only, never in tracked files.
- Commit only when asked. GitHub: `ChestPiece/clinic-whatsapp-bot` (private), branch `master`.
- Vercel deploys every push to `master` to production. Paste a new migration before pushing code that needs it.
- Ask before any Supabase write; the owner runs SQL in the SQL editor.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev
npm test        # vitest
npm run lint
```

## Production
- Vercel project `chestpieces-projects/clinic-whatsapp-bot`. Public URL: `https://sara-clinic-bot.vercel.app`, added as a project domain through the Vercel API. The default `*-chestpieces-projects.vercel.app` URLs sit behind Vercel deployment protection, which redirects with a 302, so UltraMsg cannot reach them.
- The UltraMsg webhook points at `https://sara-clinic-bot.vercel.app/api/whatsapp?secret=…`. The GitHub repo is connected, so a push to `master` deploys (`npx vercel deploy --prod` also works). Env vars live in Vercel production and in `.env.local`.
- Local testing takes webhook traffic away from prod. Point UltraMsg back to prod when done.

## Local testing
- Dev server plus a cloudflared quick tunnel. The tunnel URL changes on every restart: update the UltraMsg webhook (`POST /instance/settings`, `webhook_url`) each time.
- UltraMsg settings: only "Webhook on Received" on, `sendDelay=1`, `sendDelayMax=3`.
- To reset a test chat, delete its `conversations` row in Supabase.
- The webhook secret travels in the query string (UltraMsg has no signature header), so it shows in tunnel and Vercel request logs. Rotate it if those logs are ever shared.

## Tenants (P0)
- Each clinic is a `clinics` row: config (`slug`, `persona`, `staff_whatsapp`, `ultramsg_instance_id` as digits only, `active`). Its UltraMsg token and webhook secret live in `clinic_secrets` (service role only, never read by the dashboard).
- New clinic: insert a `clinics` row and a `clinic_secrets` row, then point that UltraMsg instance's webhook at `/api/whatsapp?secret=<its webhook_secret>`. One webhook URL serves every clinic: the payload `instanceId` picks the clinic.
- Env vars `CLINIC_ID`, `ULTRAMSG_INSTANCE_ID`, `ULTRAMSG_TOKEN`, `STAFF_WHATSAPP` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` are no longer read. `ALLOWED_SENDERS` is still a global env allowlist.
- Code: `src/lib/clinics.ts` (loaders, 5-min cache), `src/lib/sara.ts` (agent brain shared by all channels: tools, prompt, `runSara`), `src/lib/agent.ts` (WhatsApp channel handler).
- Every patient/assistant/outbound turn also goes to `messages` (readable transcript for the inbox); token use per run goes to `usage_events`.

## Web chat (P1, first cut)
- `/chat/[slug]` (shadcn + AI Elements, `useChat`) talks to `POST /api/chat`, which streams the same Sara agent (`streamSara`) through `createAiSdkUiMessageStreamResponse`. History lives server side in `conversations`, like WhatsApp; the client sends only its newest message.
- Visitor = anonymous id in localStorage, stored as `patients.web_visitor_id` (`wa_id` is null). Sara asks for a mobile number before a web booking or handoff; web handoff alerts staff on WhatsApp with a callback number and does not pause the chat.
- Tool results are structured (`find_slots`, `book`), so the chat draws tappable time buttons and a booking card.
- Chat history comes back after a reload (`GET /api/chat`). Not yet: embeddable `widget.js` + `allowed_origins` check, per-IP rate limit, reminders for web patients.
- UI components are vendored by the shadcn (`new-york`, Radix) and AI Elements CLIs in `src/components/{ui,ai-elements}` and skipped by ESLint.

## Design (clean SaaS, 2026-10-25, replaces "The Ledger")
- **Brand guidelines are locked in `.tastemaker/style-lock.md`. Read it before any UI work and follow it; change it only when Anas asks.**
- Neutral stone palette + sage `--primary`, blue `--web`, red `--alert` (tokens in `src/app/globals.css`). Geist (UI + headings), Geist Mono (sparing), Readex Pro for Arabic. No paper texture. `.slip` now means a plain card; `.torn-top` is a no-op kept for old dashboard markup.
- Logo: the `Front Desk.` wordmark (Newsreader, red full stop). Always use `<Logo />` from `src/components/logo.tsx`; Newsreader is loaded only for it (`.wordmark` utility).
- Landing (2026-10-26): hero with EN/عربي demo replay, pinned "night shift" story (`NightShift` in `src/components/landing.tsx`: chat books a visit, Flip flies it into the calendar), hairline features, safety list. GSAP only via `src/lib/gsap.ts`.
- Chat: left collapsible sidebar (Back to site, New chat, clinic hours/services/location in `<details>`), left sheet on phones; starter questions sit under the greeting in the empty state.
- Login: split layout, form left, static "while you were closed" sample right (desktop only).
- Dashboard: page titles `text-3xl font-semibold`, no GSAP, no uppercase labels. Responsive grids need `grid-cols-1` as the base so wide children (calendar) cannot push past the phone width.
- Shared pieces in `src/components/ledger.tsx`: `WeekCalendar`, `Tally`, `Typed`, `Line`, `ThemeToggle`.

## Staff dashboard (P2)
- `0005_dashboard.sql` (applied 2026-10-25): `memberships`, `platform_admins`, `is_member()`, RLS read/update policies, staff-only message inserts, Realtime on messages/conversations/appointments. Its header says how to add a staff user.
- Auth: `@supabase/ssr`, `src/proxy.ts` guards `/dashboard`, `/login` (password or magic link, no sign-up). Needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env.local` and Vercel.
- Pages read with the user's client (RLS). Helpers in `src/lib/dashboard.ts`, server actions in `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts`. Clinic switcher (cookie) when a user has several clinics.
  - Today: tallies (booked by Sara this week, after hours, need staff), first waiting chat, this week's book.
  - Inbox: chats from `messages`, Needs staff filter (`stillPaused`), Take over / Hand back, staff reply on WhatsApp (sent with the clinic's creds via the service role, logged as role `staff`, appended to the agent history). Website chats are read-only.
  - Calendar: Saturday-start week, blocks by channel (red = chat waiting for staff), mark came in / no-show / cancel.
  - Patients: search + tags, profile with details, staff notes, visits, transcript.
- `Live` re-renders pages on Realtime changes. Not yet: manual booking or moving visits from the dashboard, live replies into web chats.

## How `handleMessage` works (`src/lib/agent.ts`)
1. Dedupe insert (`processed_messages`, with `patient_wa`) and clinic load (cached 5 min) in parallel.
2. Rate limit: more than 20 messages from one sender in 10 min gets one "slow down" reply, then silence (emergencies still get the fixed reply). Then `markRead` (blue ticks; UltraMsg has no typing indicator).
3. Input caps: text cut to 1,500 chars; voice notes only from public https URLs and under 3 MB.
4. Emergency (`safety.ts`, deterministic EN/AR regex): fixed 998 reply, appended to history, model does not run. Works even when the chat is paused.
5. Debounce 1.5 s, in the DB so it works across Vercel instances: each piece's text goes in `processed_messages.body`; only the newest piece (`seq`) runs the model and answers every unanswered piece from the last 5 min. If a newer piece arrives while the model runs, the older reply is dropped, unless the older run wrote data (`wroteData`: book, cancel, reschedule, handoff).
6. Paused chat (`stillPaused`): staff own it; the patient's messages are still saved to history; the pause lapses after 30 min.
7. Run the agent, send `tidy(reply)` (no en/em dashes), log `[timing]`, then append this run's turns to the latest saved history (`mergeHistory`) and keep the last 10 turns.

## Outbound jobs (`src/lib/jobs.ts`, `POST /api/cron?secret=CRON_SECRET`)
- pg_cron + pg_net call the cron route every 15 min (job `clinic-jobs`, live since 2026-10-22). The schedule SQL is at the bottom of `0003_revenue.sql`. Check runs in the Vercel logs (`[cron]` lines) or in `cron.job_run_details`.
- Reminders: 24h and 2h before a booked visit, in English and Arabic, with "Reply 1 to confirm or 2 to change it". A visit gets no reminder for a window it was booked inside. Each reminder is claimed (`reminded_*_at`) before it is sent, so it goes out at most once. The reminder text is appended to the chat history, so the agent understands the "1" or "2" reply (`confirm_visit` tool; a reschedule clears `confirmed_at`).
- Follow-up: one nudge when a patient's last message is 3 to 20 h old and they have nothing booked, are not opted out and the chat is not paused. Only one per quiet inquiry (`conversations.followup_sent_at`). The nudge names the last service mentioned in the chat and the next free time. A booking within 48 h of the nudge gets `source='followup'`.
- STOP (or توقف) as a whole message sets `patients.opted_out`: no follow-up, recall or waitlist messages, but reminders still go out. "الغاء" is not a stop word, because it means "cancel".
- Outbound limits: no messages between 21:00 and 09:00 clinic time, and at most 20 per run.

Booking limits: at most 3 upcoming visits per patient, and dates up to 60 days ahead. A stored patient name is never overwritten by a later booking.
Errors: the SORRY reply promises a staff reply only when the clinic's `staff_whatsapp` is set; otherwise it gives the clinic phone.

Handoff pauses a chat only when the clinic's `staff_whatsapp` is set; without it the bot keeps helping and gives the clinic phone.

## Status
- Phase 0: webhook + `parseWebhook` tests done.
- Phase 1 done and tested live (book, cancel) on 2026-10-22.
- Phase 1.5 (natural tone + speed) done and stress-tested live on 2026-10-22: off-topic declines, no dashes, booking with "best one" choice all good. Fixed after that test: double emergency reply, and two replies to a split message.
- Break-test and hardening on 2026-10-22 (`0002_hardening.sql`): rate limit, input caps, voice URL guard, booking caps, wider EN/AR/Arabizi emergency regex without the "accident last year" false alarm, DB debounce for Vercel, history merge, paused-chat history, honest error reply.
- 2026-10-22: `0002_hardening.sql` applied, replays re-verified, deployed to Vercel (R0, R1).
- 2026-10-22: R2 reminders + confirm and R3 follow-up + STOP are live (`0003_revenue.sql` applied, cron scheduled).
- 2026-10-25: P0 multi-tenant foundation done (`0004_tenants.sql` applied with its backfill block, deployed in 7d410b3).
- 2026-10-25: web chat first cut coded (`/chat/sample-smile`). 0004 now also adds `patients.web_visitor_id` and `phone`.
- 2026-10-25: landing page and web chat redesigned ("Stone & Sage": Manrope + Readex Pro, stone background with sage/sand washes, full-screen chat with a clinic info sidebar). Tokens and rules in `.tastemaker/style-lock.md`. Deployed in 7d410b3.
- 2026-10-25: Ledger design on the whole app; P2 dashboard coded (not committed or deployed yet).
- **Demo freeze (2026-10-22):** the owner judged the current bot enough to demo to leads and gather feedback. R4 onward is on hold until lead feedback comes in.
- On hold:
  - R4 waitlist + recall (`0003` already has the recall columns and `appointments.source`).
  - R5 intake + insurance docs.
  - R6 staff inbox + Sunday owner report.
  - R7 evals. They must include the stress transcripts: off-topic, split messages, "hello?", emergency then "just joking".
  - R8 pitch kit.
- Demo limits to know:
  - The number is UltraMsg on a test SIM, and `ALLOWED_SENDERS` limits who gets answers.
  - Staff and owner alerts go to the test number.
  - Images get a "can't view" reply.
  - Only one chair per clinic is supported.
