# Style lock: Front Desk, clean SaaS

Locked 2026-10-25 (supersedes "The Ledger"). Applies to every surface: landing, patient chat, dashboard, login. Change only when Anas asks.

## Direction contract
- Calm, credible product for clinic owners. Neutral stone surfaces, one sage accent, plain sans type. The AI stays quiet: no sparkle icons, no gradients, no "AI" cues.
- Light and dark. System default plus a toggle (next-themes, `.dark` class).

## Logo
- The logo is the wordmark `Front Desk.`: Newsreader 400, tracking -0.02em, ink colour, with the full stop in `--alert` red.
- Use `<Logo />` from `src/components/logo.tsx` (it applies the `.wordmark` utility). Never retype it by hand.
- No icon mark, no box behind it, no other colour. Size it with a text class only (`text-2xl` header, `text-xl` footer, sidebar, dashboard).
- Newsreader is for the wordmark only. Never use it for headings or UI text.

## Color contract (tokens in `src/app/globals.css`)
| Role | Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page | `--background` | #fafaf9 | #0c0a09 |
| Card | `--card` | #ffffff | #171412 |
| Ink | `--foreground` | #0c0a09 | #f5f5f4 |
| Muted text | `--muted-foreground` | #6b6560 | #a8a29e |
| Border | `--border` | #e7e5e4 | #292524 |
| Sage: primary, WhatsApp, user bubbles | `--primary` | #4f6f5c | #93b59d |
| Blue: website channel | `--web` | #33506e | #93aecb |
| Red: needs staff, logo dot | `--alert` | #ad4320 | #e8825f |

- Sage is the only accent on marketing surfaces. Blue and red carry meaning (channel, needs staff) and appear in the dashboard and the logo dot only.
- No hard-coded hex in components. Add a token first.

## Type contract
- Geist for all UI and headings. Headings semibold, tracking -0.02em to -0.03em at display sizes.
- Geist Mono only for times, prices and IDs, sparingly.
- Readex Pro is the Arabic fallback in the sans stack. Use `dir="auto"` on user text.
- No italics for emphasis, no uppercase micro-labels, no serif headings.

## Shape and space
- Radius 0.75rem (`--radius`); cards `rounded-xl`, composer and hero mock `rounded-2xl`, pills `rounded-full`.
- Borders over shadows. At most `shadow-sm` (floating navbar, composer).
- Content width `max-w-6xl` (landing), `max-w-3xl` (chat column). Section rhythm `py-20`, side gutter `px-4 sm:px-6`.

## Patterns
- Landing: floating rounded navbar (logo, links, Sign in, Try the demo), hero with chat replay, features, how it works, safety, sage CTA band, footer with logo + theme toggle.
- Chat: left collapsible sidebar (logo, Back to site, New chat, clinic card, `<details>` info blocks, theme toggle); a left sheet on phones. Assistant replies are plain text, patient replies are sage bubbles.
- Motion (relaxed 2026-10-26): UI feedback stays 150-250 ms ease-out. GSAP (`src/lib/gsap.ts`, ScrollTrigger + Flip + SplitText) is allowed on marketing pages: one pinned scroll story per page, scroll reveals, a hero line reveal; scroll-linked moves up to 900 ms, eases `power3`/`expo`, no bounce. Reduced motion: no pin, final state shown. Dashboard: no GSAP.
- Fluid scale: `text-display`, `text-h2`, `text-lead`, `py-section` (clamp tokens in `globals.css`). Hero fits the first viewport.

## Banned
Paper/dot textures, torn edges, gradient blobs, glassmorphism beyond the navbar blur, emoji in UI, icon-in-a-square logos, invented stats or client logos.
